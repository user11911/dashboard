# dashboard
the odin project dashboard

it should contain on the right side a navbar, on the top a search bar and a welcome, 
and on the right side announcements and trending wiht some profile pictures.
 on the top right there should be a dark-light change theme and a page management area.
  on the center there should be a post area. also add some animations, smooth movement, and keyframes for different viewing deevices and areas. use css grid.

# order

The first thing i shuould do is divide the pages in the right way and already organize for compatibility with different screen sizes. Ill make three different sizes: mobile, computer-shrink and computer-full. i should change the smoothness and add the most important animations and user-experience improvers from the starrt. then i should add the content with preicse classes for links and features. I should already set up the spaces for all the things with grids.

# content

layout1: logo, searchbar and welcome esclamation, user features.
layout2: links to features (home,, profile, messages, history, tasks, community and settings, support and privacy)
layout3: projects with dashboards
layout4: announcements with some announcements and trending, with some profile links.
